              "\"hello learners in this session we are going to discuss on the indian music and its divisions. The three art forms music dance and drama have been an integral aspects of indian culture art reflects human emotions and human beings spontaneously express their frame of mind through various art forms  singing dancing acting are attributes of performing arts. The earliest text dealing exclusively with performing arts is bharata s natyashashtra compiled between second century bc and second century ad. Many rulers such as samudragupta king bhoja of dhara and king someshavra of kalyana patronised music. Music was also associated with the worship of gods and goddess in the temples. The musicians of hindustani classical music are usually associated to a gharana or a particular style of music. gharanas refer to hereditary linkages of musicians which represent the core of the style and distinguish them from the other. The most famous are sitar sarod santoor, sarangi, pakhawaj tabla and mridangam. Carnatic music may be attributed collectively to three composers who lived between 1700 and 1850. The main compositions are known as kriti and are devotional in nature. Despite contrasting features between hindustani and carnatic music one can find some similarities. modern indian music with the british rule came western music  indians adopted some of their instruments such as violin and clarinet. music education no longer depends on the masterdisciple system but can be imparted through institutions teaching music  folk music besides classical music india has a rich legacy of folk or popular music  this music represents the emotion of the masses. We will discuss on the indian dance and drama dances of india like music. Dance was to give symbolic expression to religious ideas. Dance in temples had a religious objective whereas in courts it was used purely for entertainment. Classical dance forms like kathakali bharatnatyam and odishi are an important part of our cultural heritage. For the artists devoted to this art form it was no less than praying to god. in southern india bharatanatyam and mohiniattam developed as an important aspect of the rituals in temples. folk dances evolved from the lives of common people and were performed in unison. in the last few decades the status of dance as well as its performers has changed. several renowned classical dancers have been awarded national awards like the padmashree. indigenous tradition as well as modern research trace the origin of indian drama to the vedas. In the ramayana we hear of drama troupes of women while kautilyas arthshastra mentions musicians dancers and dramatic shows. Drama achieved a great level of perfection during the age of bharata. Short skits and long plays were enacted to preach and educate the masses. Music and dance also played a vital role in increasing the appeal of drama. Two types developed the classic drama which had intricacies of theme and subtle nuances of dramatic traits and folk theatre. Folk theatre emerged during british rule. It began as an outlet to vent frustration against the rulers. It became the medium through which various socioeconomic issues like secularism nationalism and casteism were highlighted. The very nature of music dance and drama elevates human soul and creates a pleasant atmosphere. Indians like people in other parts of the world have a rich tradition of scientific ideas.
